+ Simple networks for job transmission
Throughout vasts swaths of society, people hear about jobs and find employment through social contacts.
- The characteristics of the social networks that each person maintains affect their ability to stay employed and advance their careers.
- Simulations on a simple graph yield insights on these effects.
-- Nodes (vertices) are agents and edges are social connections.
-- Workers in the same graph component will have correlated employment histories.
-- More-closely connected nodes will be more correlated.
-- More-densely connected networks will have higher average employment.
-- Expected gains from employment in a given network structure affect probability of remaining in the labor force.

+ The Model
In each period: 
- With probability $a=0.1$, each agent receives a job offer.
- If the agent is unemployed, he keeps the offer; if he is unemployed, he transmits it to a random, currently unemployed ``neighbor."
-- Employment status is based on the ``last period."
-- Jobs can only be transmitted once.
- With probability $b=0.015$, every job or accepted offer is destroyed.

+ What to confirm? [1 of 4]
-[A] §II, Ex. 1a: given $s⃗_{t-1}$, $s_{1t}$ and $s_{3t}$ are negatively correlated.
-[B] §II, Ex. 1b: in the long run, agent 3 benefits agent 1.
-[C] §II, Ex. 2: for the graphs shown, the probabilities and correlations below.

+ What to confirm? [2 of 4]
-[D] §II, Ex. 2, \P6: the networks shown demonstrate that the probability of unemployment falls in the number of links, and correlations between nodes fall with the length of the shortest path between them.
-- For A, $\text{Corr}(s₁, s₂) > \text{Corr}(s₁, s₃) > \text{Corr}(s₁, s₄) > \text{Corr}(s₁, s₅)$.
-- The average unemployment is 6\% for A, and 3\% for B.

+ What to confirm? [3 of 4]
-[E] Ex. 3: even with equal numbers of links, the position in a network affects employment.
-- The average rates are: $s̅₁=0.047$, $s̅₂=0.048$, and $s̅₃=0.05$.

+ What to confirm? [4 of 4]
-[F] Ex. 4: the average distance between nodes affects the long-run average employment, in the entire network.
-- Average path lengths for A and B are 1.571 and 1.786.
-- Average unemployment rates for A and B are 0.048 and 0.049.

+ Necessary Functionality
- Read in arbitrary graphs (trivial) and put them in a dictionary.
-- We'll use the \link{https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html}{glob.glob()} function to list files.
-- I've provided json descriptions of all the graphs we'll consider.
- \chred{Implement job creation, transmission, and loss mechanisms}
-- Save each agent's employment record for study
-- See \link{https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html\#real-valued-distributions}{random.random()} -- we'll want $\tt{random()} < a$.
-- Use \link{https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html\#functions-for-sequences}{random.choice()} to choose a random neighbor, or \link{https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html\#functions-for-sequences}{random.shuffle()} to choose a random ordering of neighbors.
- Calculate employment rates
- Calculate correlations among agents
- Calculate minimum distance between agents

- Bonus make all this scriptable!

+ Implementing the Model! \tright See \tt{caj-ex/caj\_tools.py}.

+ A Computational Shortcut
- Normally, the variance is $σ² = E[X²] - E[X]²$.
- But we have only two states (0 and 1), and $x = x²$ for both of them.
- In that case, defining $µ ≡ X̅$,
\[ σ² = µ - µ². \]
- As a reminder, the correlation is 
\[ ρ_{XY} = E[(X-µ_X)(Y-µ_X)]/(σ_X σ_Y). \]

+ Straightforward Extensions
In §IV, Calvó-Armengol and Jackson model drop-out rates with contagion, and different initial conditions (and costs to employment).
- Part-analytic calculation of exp. costs to staying in the labor force.
>2em 
Two classes of people $A$ and $B$, with different initial employment histories.
- Study time to convergence, for various levels of segregation.
- Allow the job obtention rate to depend on past employment history (over a certain number of periods).
>2em 
Far more broadly: any number of agent-based models.
